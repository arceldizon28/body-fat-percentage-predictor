# body-fat-percentage-predictor
Body FAt percentage predictor using linear regression gradient descent with feature engineering.
This is a revision of my last academic project I did in university. It used a lasso regression gradient descent to train the models and reduce the number of features. This revision uses a linear regression gradient descent instead and I reduced the features via feature engineering.
